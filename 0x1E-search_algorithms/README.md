## Big O notations
* O(1)
* O(n)
* O(n!)
* n*m -> O(nm)
* n square -> O(n^2)
* sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
* log(n) -> O(log(n))
* n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))

### **Tasks**
0. Linear search
> function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

1. Binary search
> function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

2. Big O #0
> time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n

3. Big O #1
> the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n

4. Big O #2
> the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

5. Big O #3
> the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

6. Big O #4
the space complexity of this function / algorithm
